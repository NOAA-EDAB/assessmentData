# assessmentdata

Stock assessments reports are typically lengthy documents containing a great deal of information. This repo contains time series data for all assessed stocks in the United States. The following time series are available:

* Catch
* Abundance - Estimate of the numbers of individuals in the population
* Index - An index of biomass for the population
* Recruitment - Abundance of Juveniles
* Fishing mortality

Summary statistics for these assessments are also available (FMSY, BMSY, Ftarget etc) in addition to metadata (Jurisdiction, Point of contact, Year of assessment etc)

The data are extracted from NOAA's [Stock SMART](https://www.st.nmfs.noaa.gov/stocksmart?app=homepage) web based data portal and processed. The result is a data frame in long format.
